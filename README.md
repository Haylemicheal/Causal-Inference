## Overview
Our client for this project is a delivery company. The company works in partnered with motorbike owners and drivers to deliver parcels across Lagos, Nigeria. This company has  an issue of high number of unfulfilled delivery requests. The cause of this problem is 
the sub-optimal placement of pilots and clients who wants to sent their parcel. 

In this project we are supposed to work on the data to help the company understand the primary causes of unfulfilled requests as well as come up with solutions that recommend drivers locations that increase the fraction of complete orders. Since drivers are paid based on the number of requests they accept, your solution will help the company business grow both in terms of client satisfaction and increased business.
